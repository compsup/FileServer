# Information

I made this project to solve the problem of there being no good free and open-source website fileserver. There's storage things like OneDrive but they are not open-source and also require money after you used up the free space. This program aims to be secure, reliable, and free forever.

# Features

- Randomly generated folders per file
- Full user authentication system
- User profiles
- File Table to view files

### ToDo

- Easily delete files from files view
- Add a settings page for users
- Have a page where its shows only what certain users uploaded.

# Technologies

- [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 5
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 3.1.5
